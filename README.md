## What I learned

Mobile first responsive design, this time round I wanted a site that was a lot more fluid then my other's. I think I was teaching myself some bad habits trying desktop first and setting widths and heights on everything to try and get it all perfect. However doing this the first time round I could not adjust anything when trying to get the page ready for mobile.
<br>
<br>
Background images again. I like to thinks this time I've simplified the HTML and CSS for adding two background images. I spent 1-2 hours on w3schools reading up on their manipulation of background images.
<br>
<br>
Flexbox and more impotantly placing of content with `flex-direction`, `align-items` & `justify-content` etc.
